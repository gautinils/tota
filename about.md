Tóta Van Helzing is a knitwear designer and a textile artist from Reykjavík, Iceland. Tóta makes hand-knitted expressive pieces of knitwear, that can seem a little bold, almost crazy. Only working with yarn she finds at thrift-stores, creating sustainable pieces from recycled material. The play with texture and color makes each sweater an outstanding artwork, a wearable piece of art.
